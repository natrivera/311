1. [Microproject 1](https://natrivera.github.io/311/micro1/) 
  <br>Decide upon a general project theme, related to a real world subject, company, or concept. 
  Create four pages then connect them with a Bootstrap menu. Create a version available via 
  mobile, using Onsen. Create a registration page which accepts an email. Create a username
  page which asks for a username and password, as well as their full name. Validate that these 
  fields contain inputs once they press a Submit button on both pages. Be sure you have coded 
  each unit 1 example source on our github. 
2. [Microproject 2](https://natrivera.github.io/311/micro2/)
   <br>Construct a javascript object to contain the email, on the Registration page. Construct a 
javascript object to contain the username and password on the username page. Apply input 
validation to both username and registration pages, ensuring the inputs you desire are 
submitted, when the Submit is pused. When bad inputs are put in, please throw a Bootstrap 
Alert. Assume that you must have MP 1, including a navigation menu system with Bootstrap. 
Add a home page which announces your project and contains several columns which describe 
what the site is about. Use the Bootstrap Jumbotron on the home page. 
3. [Microproject 3](https://natrivera.github.io/311/micro3/)
   <br>Create a new page where the user gets access to data. Craft a JSON object which contains 
sample data and organize it on the page using Bootstrap columns. This page should link within 
your Bootstrap navigation system, available on each page. Make a .js file that allows you to 
update the menu in one file, then use it across all of your pages.
