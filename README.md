  Decide upon a general project theme, related to a real world subject, company, or concept. 
  Create four pages then connect them with a Bootstrap menu. Create a version available via 
  mobile, using Onsen. Create a registration page which accepts an email. Create a username
  page which asks for a username and password, as well as their full name. Validate that these 
  fields contain inputs once they press a Submit button on both pages. Be sure you have coded 
  each unit 1 example source on our github.
